# Weather Forcaster Telegram bot
This project aims to make a telegram bot that gives information about current weather and daily weather forecast for a selected city. The project was built using ruby language.

My major driving force to implement this project is to simplify the process of getting accurate current and daily weather reports of major cities around the world just by entering the city in the telegram app installed on your device.
This project calls OpenWeather API to retrieve information for current weather or daily weather forecast for the chosen city. You need to provide the name of the city and your country code when prompted by the telegram app. This bot will also help you identify your two-letter country code if you do not know it. Information for all the major cities in the OpenWeather database can be retrieved. This project helps you to know your current weather report easily from the telegram app installed on your device any time of the day.

## Main Features Of This Bot
- It can display an array of sample cities you can follow when entering your city.
- It can display current weather information of selected city specifying details such as temperature, pressure, latitude, longitude, wind speed, humidity, visibility, your city, and country code.
- It can display daily weather forecasts with the same details specified above including cloud state.
- Bot shows a link that will display a List of ISO 3166 two-letter country codes.
- Bot works in a telegram app installed on devices like computers, mobile phones, and tablets.

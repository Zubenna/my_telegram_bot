# Weather Forcaster Telegram bot

The aim of this project is to make a telegram bot that gives information about current weather and daily weather forecast for a selected city. Project was built using ruby language.

My major driving force to implement this project is to simplify the process of getting accurate current and daily weather report of major cities around the world just by entering the city in the telegram app installed in your device.
This project calls OpenWeather API to retrieve information for current weather or daily weather forcast for the chosen city. You need to provide the name of the city and your country code when prompted by the telegram app. Infomation for all the major cities in OpenWeather database can be retreived. This project helps you to know your current weather report easily from the telegram app installed in your device any time of the day.

## Main Features Of This Bot

- It can display current weather information of selected city specifying details such as temperature, pressure, latitude, longitude, wind speed, humudity, visibility, your city and country code.
